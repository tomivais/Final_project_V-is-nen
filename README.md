  The app is designed to track your study time. It allows you to keep track of your study time history. 
  The app includes user management, which requires you to register first. Once registered, the user can then log in with their account and start tracking their study time. 
  Study time can be started and ended, which will generate timestamps that can be viewed in a table view. 



  You need to have a json server to run it. You need to start a server for the project: 
  json-server --watch db_studies.json --port 3000, json-server --watch user_db.json --port 3001.  
  In addition to this, you need to start the application on any port. You would just need to download: npm install. Then run the application: npm run dev.

  You can log in: example@gmail.com password:1234.

  // db_studiess: Generated studing data with Colap

  //user_db include Registered user

  //The return also includes pause functions off comment when the project time resources are overflowed.
  In addition, the original goal was to add a datepicker to the table view page. However, this is my first web application and I am proud of the result.   

  

 The work has been done with the help of OpenAI and Copilot. User management and logging out in the middle of a study session require a lot of time to implement. 
 The youtube videos has been used to help with the implementation of user management: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QapLfhqU8wY,  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OV-TYyJEnw&t=0s.
