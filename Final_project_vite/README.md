  The app is designed to track your study time. It allows you to keep track of your study time history. The app includes user management, which requires you to register first. Once registered, the user can then log in with their account and start tracking their study time. Study time can be started and ended, which will generate timestamps that can be viewed in a table view. 



  You need to have a json server to run it. You need to start a server for the project e.g.: json-server --watch db_studies.json --port 3000, json-server --watch user_db.json --port 3001.  In addition to this, you need to start the application on any port. 

  You would just need to download: npm install. Then run the application: npm run dev.

  // db_studiess: Generated studies data with gemini

  //user_db include Registered user

  //The return also includes pause functions off comment when the project time resources are overflowed.
